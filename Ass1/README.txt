============================

To use do_tmux.sh and demo_test.sh, the program "tmux" must be installed (already installed on linux.csc)

1. Copy the tmux.conf file to ~/.tmux.conf (this allowed you to use your mouse with tmux)

2. Make sure you have .uvshrc in your directory and a compiled version of uvsh.c

3. Run ./do_tmux.sh

4. In the pane on the right side, run ./demo_test.sh demo_input.txt
